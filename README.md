## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Devansh and I'm a senior at Texas Christian University, currently studying Physics and Math. Passionate about the elegance that they have to offer, I've apparently found myself combining their applications with programming over here!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building computational physics projects! Below are a few that I've worked on, both inside and outside the classroom - feel free to reach out to me if you want to collaborate!!
